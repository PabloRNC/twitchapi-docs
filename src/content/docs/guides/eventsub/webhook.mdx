Twitchfy allows to listen events through Webhooks. By default an express server is required to handle the incoming events from Twitch. Nevertheless, an alternative will be explored in this guide.

## Creating a Webhook

To create a Webhook firstly we have to initialize a server to receive incoming data. To do this we are going to use Express.

```ts title=webhook.ts
import express from 'express';

const server = express();
```

Having created an express server we are going to use it to create a new [WebhookConnection](/api/eventsub/classes/webhookconnection).

```ts title=webhook.ts

import express from 'express'
import { WebhookConnection } from '@twitchfy/eventsub';

const server = express();

server.listen(3333);

const connection = new WebhookConnection({
    clientId: 'clientId',
    clientSecret: 'clientSecret',
    appToken: 'appToken',
    maintainSubscriptions: false,
    secret: 'myAwesomeSecret',
    baseURL: 'https://mybaseurl.com'
}, server)

connection.start();
```

As you have seen, to create a WebhookConnection we need a secret. It is important to notice that is not the same as the clientSecret, the secret is used for protecting your webhook from malicious attacks. The `baseURL` field is your own url that will point at your server, it has to use a `https` protocol.

:::tip
For maintaining subscription between processes see [Subscription Reload](./subscriptionreload).
:::

To wait until the connection is fully operational you can either wait until the `start` method promise is resolved or listen to `ConnectionReady` event.

```ts title=webhook.ts ins={17, 19-21}

import express from 'express'
import { WebhookConnection, Events } from '@twitchfy/eventsub';

const server = express();

const connection = new WebhookConnection({
    clientId: 'clientId',
    clientSecret: 'clientSecret',
    appToken: 'appToken',
    maintainSubscriptions: false,
    secret: 'myAwesomeSecret',
    baseURL: 'https://mybaseurl.com'
}, server)

server.listen(3333);

connection.start().then(() => console.log('Connection ready'));

connection.on(Events.ConnectionReady, () => {
    console.log('Connection ready x2')
})
```

## Subscribing to events

Having created a functional Webhook connection it is time to subscribe to our first event. 

This example will show how to subscribe to a `StreamOnline` event.

```ts title='webhook.ts' ins={22-24}

import express from 'express'
import { WebhookConnection, Events } from '@twitchfy/eventsub';

const server = express();

server.listen(3333);

const connection = new WebhookConnection({
    clientId: 'clientId',
    clientSecret: 'clientSecret',
    appToken: 'appToken',
    maintainSubscriptions: false,
    secret: 'myAwesomeSecret',
    baseURL: 'https://mybaseurl.com'
}, server)

connection.start().then(() => console.log('Connection ready'));

connection.on(Events.ConnectionReady, async() => {
    console.log('Connection ready x2');

    await connection.subscribe({ type: SubscriptionTypes.StreamOnline, options: {
        broadcaster_user_id: 'userId'
    }})
})
```

:::danger
It's crucial to subscribe to events when the connection is fully estabilished. If not the package will likely throw an error
:::

:::tip
You can subscribe to multiple events at once using `subscribeAll` method.
:::

## Listening events

Now that you have created a new subscription we will listen to it and get notified whenever it is fired.

To achive this we can either use a callback using the `onMessage` function in the subscription object or using the `SubscriptionMessage` event.

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Callback">

```ts showLineNumbers copy title="webhook.ts" ins={26-28}

import express from 'express'
import { WebhookConnection, Events } from '@twitchfy/eventsub';

const server = express();

server.listen(3333);

const connection = new WebhookConnection({
    clientId: 'clientId',
    clientSecret: 'clientSecret',
    appToken: 'appToken',
    maintainSubscriptions: false,
    secret: 'myAwesomeSecret',
    baseURL: 'https://mybaseurl.com'
}, server)

connection.start().then(() => console.log('Connection ready'));

connection.on(Events.ConnectionReady, async() => {
    console.log('Connection ready x2');

    const subscription = await connection.subscribe({ type: SubscriptionTypes.StreamOnline, options: {
        broadcaster_user_id: 'userId'
    }})

    subscription.onMessage((message) => {
        console.log(`${message.broadcaster.displayName} has started a stream at ${message.stream.startedAt.toLocaleDateString()}`)
    })
})
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem label="SubscriptionMessage">

```ts showLineNumbers copy title="webhook.ts" ins={27-30}
import express from 'express'
import { WebhookConnection, Events } from '@twitchfy/eventsub';

const server = express();

server.listen(3333);

const connection = new WebhookConnection({
    clientId: 'clientId',
    clientSecret: 'clientSecret',
    appToken: 'appToken',
    maintainSubscriptions: false,
    secret: 'myAwesomeSecret',
    baseURL: 'https://mybaseurl.com'
}, server)

connection.start().then(() => console.log('Connection ready'));

connection.on(Events.ConnectionReady, async() => {
    console.log('Connection ready x2');

    await connection.subscribe({ type: SubscriptionTypes.StreamOnline, options: {
        broadcaster_user_id: 'userId'
    }})
})

connection.on(Events.SubscriptionMessage, (message, subscription) => {
    //checks if the subscription is the desired subscription
    if(subscription.checkSubscriptionType(SubscriptionTypes.StreamOnline)) console.log(`${message.broadcaster.displayName} has started a stream at ${message.stream.startedAt.toLocaleDateString()}`)
})
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Custom Server

As mentioned at the start of this section, the package has been made to be used with an express server. Furthermore, there is a way to use another type of server which was not created with express.

To achive this we are going to use the `post` function from the connection object to send the data we have received from our server. By default the events will be sent to the base url callback + `/subscriptions' route. Althrough you can customize it in the subscriptions options by setting the `subscriptionRoute` option. To see the full url where the events will go you can access to `WebhookConnection.url` field.

In this example we are going to use the node native module `https`.

```ts title=webhook.ts

    import { WebhookConnection, Events } from '@twitchfy/eventsub';

    const server = express();

    const connection = new WebhookConnection({
        clientId: 'clientId',
        clientSecret: 'clientSecret',
        appToken: 'appToken',
        maintainSubscriptions: false,
        secret: 'myAwesomeSecret',
        baseURL: 'https://mybaseurl.com'
    })

    http.createServer(async(req, res) => {
        if(req.url === connection.subscriptionRoute && req.method === 'POST'){
            let body = ''
            req.on('data', (chunk) => {
                body += chunk.toString();
            })
            req.on('end', async() => {
                return await connection.post(req.headers, JSON.parse(body), (c) => {
                    res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain', 'Content-Length': c.length })
                    res.write(c)
                    res.end();
                }, () => {
                    res.writeHead(200).end();
                })
            })
        }
    }).listen(3333)

```

In this example the `post` function is used whenever you receive a post request to the subscription route. The post function sends the package the data that has been received. The first callback which has a `challenge` parameter is fired whenever the webhook callback needs to be verified. The second callback is used whenever the package has received the data and checked the secret signature.

In the challenge callback you will have to respond to the request with a `200` status code and send the challenge param. Furthermore you have to change the `Content-Type` header to `text/plain` and the `Content-Length` header to the length of the challenge param.

In the success callback you will have to send a `200` status code to Twitch to say that all is ok and you have received the event.

:::note
There is a third callback whenever the secret signature could not been verified.
:::

:::important
If you fail to respond to the challenge callback any notification will be sent to you. Furhtermore, if you fail to respond to the success callback Twitch will try to send the event continously and finally will revoke the subscription.
