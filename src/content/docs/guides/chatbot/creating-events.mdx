Within this package you can create event listeners to listen to eventsub events.

:::note
The possible events you can listen are in [Events](/api/chatbot/type-aliases/events/).

You can only listen events which your chatbot is authorize with. Normally, the broadcaster doesn't need to authorize within your app as your chatbot has moderator status.
:::

## Listening to events

By default, when you join to a channel you will listen only `ChannelChatMessage` event. To listen to the other events you will need to specify them when joining to a channel.

```js showLineNumbers copy 
chatbot.channels.join("channelId", ["ChannelUpdate", "ChannelFollow"]);
```

As you can see in the example above the chatbot is joining to a channel and then listening to the `ChannelUpdate` and `ChannelFollow` events.

You may notice that you can only subscribe to events at joining a channel, but, for your luck, you can subscribe to events whenever you want.

When you join to a channel a [ChannelProfile](/api/chatbot/classes/ChannelProfile) class is created and stored in the profiles collection within the chatbot instance.

With this class you can either unlisten events or subscribe to one or more events.

Here is an example of how get that channel profile and manage its events:

```js showLineNumbers copy

const profile = chatbot.profiles.get("channelId");

//could be undefined if is not found
if (profile) {
  //adding one event
  await profile.addEvent("StreamOnline");
  //adding more than one event
  await profile.addEvent(["ChannelChatClear", "ChannelFollow"]);
  //removing event
  await profile.removeEvent("StreamOnline");
}
````

## Create your first event

Before creating our first event listener we must set our events directory in the `paths` option of [ChatBotOptions](/api/chatbot/interfaces/chatbotoptions), where all the events are going to be located.

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="TypeScript">
```ts ins={9}
import { ChatBot } from '@twitchfy/chatbot';

const chatbot = new ChatBot({
    //rest of options
    ...opts,
    paths: {
        output: 'dist',
        commands: 'commands',
        events: 'events'
    }
})

````

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="JavaScript">

```js ins={9}
const { ChatBot } = require('@twitchfy/chatbot')

const chatbot = new ChatBot({
    //rest of options
    ...opts,
    paths: {
        output: 'src',
        commands: 'commands',
        events: 'events'
    }
})
````

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Now that we have set up our events base directory we are going to create our first event with [createEvent](/api/chatbot/functions/createevent) function to listen to streams which go online.

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="TypeScript">

```ts title="events/StreamOnline.ts"
import { createEvent } from "@twitchfy/chatbot";

export default createEvent({
  event: "StreamOnline",
  //data received by each event. See in the docs
  async run(chatbot, data) {
    const stream = await data.broadcaster.stream();
    //could be null because api internal caching.
    if (stream) {
      return await chatbot.messages.send(
        data.chatroomId,
        `${data.broadcaster.toString()} is currently streaming ${
          stream.game.name
        }`
      );
    } else
      return await chatbot.messages.send(
        data.chatroomId,
        `${data.broadcaster.toString()} is currently streaming.`
      );
  },
});
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="JavaScript">
```js title="events/StreamOnline.js"

const { createEvent } = require('@twitchfy/chatbot');

module.exports = createEvent({
event: 'StreamOnline',
//data received by each event. See in the docs
async run(chatbot, data){
const stream = await data.broadcaster.stream();
//could be null because api internal caching.
if(stream){
return await chatbot.messages.send(data.chatroomId, `${data.broadcaster.toString()} is currently streaming ${stream.game.name}`)
} else return await chatbot.messages.send(data.chatroomId, `${data.broadcaster.toString()} is currently streaming.`)
}
})

```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
```
